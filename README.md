# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I'm Mark!

I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and I wear many open source hats: consumer,
contributor, triager, community organizer, documentation writer, creator,
maintainer

I believe open source has a significant role to play in building a more
**vibrant**, **interconnected**, **humancentric**, and **evolutionary** world.
It's my life mission to **improve the open source ecosystem** and **expand
knowledge and access** to as many developers as possible.

I work on a number of open source projects:

- Maintainer of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Creator of
  [`chakra-formik-experiment`](https://github.com/with-heart/chakra-formik-experiment)
- Gardener at [Effective Open Source](https://effectiveopensource.dev/)
